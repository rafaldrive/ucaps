Things to do in order to start using uCaps:

1. Your vhost in Apache should have "DocumentRoot" pointed to "public" directory.

2. You need mod_rewrite in your Apache running.

3(recommended). Create the following directories:
	logs
	temp
and make sure Apache CAN write into them.
Those are commonly used.

4(optional). If you want BufferedCapsules to work - you need to make "public" directory writable by Apache.
